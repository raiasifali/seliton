```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install # npm i
```

### 3. Run Development Environment

```bash
pnpm dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

I also included a `stage` script that will build and start a production server. You can run it with:

```bash
pnpm stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
pnpm build # npm run build
pnpm start # npm start
```
